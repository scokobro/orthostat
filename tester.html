                    <h1>Intro</h1>
<p>media and cultural studies grew up in the era of the press, broadcasting and mass consumption</p>
<p>readers/viewers were after entertainment and information</p>
<p>cultural studies academics saw danger - political and commercial exploitation</p>
<p>C and MS 'founded in suspicion of owners and controllers' - mass media is a problem</p>
<p>"sender -> message -> receiver"</p>
<p>There is room for duplicity and deceit at every link: producers (hidden) motives? a message with hidden meanings? receivers doing things they would otherwise not have done? (their 'true' self has been changed - their <em>real</em> behaviour has been influenced)</p>
<p>Digital - interactive - participatory media: not receivers but USERS.</p>
<p>Dialogic model</p>
<ol>
<li>turn-taking</li>
<li>mutual productivity</li>
<li>context-specific uses</li>
<li>'almost infinitely complex  system' - produced by 'myriad unmanaged and self-organising 'users' or speakers</li>
</ol>
<p>Important elements are:</p>
<p>meaningfulness
social networks
relationships</p>
<p>emphasis on 'content/info' replace by human interaction based on self-expression, description and argumentation, also 'phatic' chatter and imaginative invention</p>
<p>Needs a different approach to the ideas of duplicity, 'hidden purposes', exploitation</p>
<p>Instead of concentrating on 'producers' - we can now look at 'populations'</p>
<p>Contexts and circumstances during the process of the 'emergence of ideas' at a society-wide level</p>
<p>Chapter outline</p>
<h1>My media studies</h1>
<p>discourse (is a set of "texts" and the interrelationships between them) VS agents</p>
<p>most popular media - are open, generative resources for growing popular self-realisation and emancipation.</p>
<p>"Popular media = popular emancipation" - but what about the fact that these media are owned by big corps etc, exploitation and advertising. </p>
<p>"Potential and long-term unintended consequences" - what might these be?
Comparison with ideas of French Revolution as spread by Panckouke's papers etc
Shakespeare also owned media stocks - did he downplay capitalism?</p>
<p>Are media academics contributing to the very problems they critique - "disempowerment, disengagement, passivity, risk aversion"?
Should we be teaching media activism, self-realisation?</p>
<p>Astute reading - adept navigation, contextual understanding, creative productivity</p>
<p>Media is a resource for popular imagination - enables the growth of knowledge</p>
<p>"enabling social technology of ideological control for a mass society"</p>
<p>"creative sector" - social technology of distributed innovation - people who make stuff aren't just the big firms any more. Ordinary people are producers.</p>
<p>enterprises still deeply involved - but (he says) what is now important is what USERS DO - not how USERS REACT.  Why do users create content? What do they do with it? And why?</p>
